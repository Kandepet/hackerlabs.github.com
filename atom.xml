    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Couple of my hobbies are travelling and photography. I love to take pictures and experiment with photography. Usually after my trips, I just copy the photos to either my iPad or couple of my external hard disks. After 10 years, I have over 200K photos distributed across several disks and machines. I had to find a way to organize these photos and create a workflow for future maintenance. In this post I want to address one of the issues I had to solve: <strong> finding duplicate images </strong>.</p>

<p>First, I needed to find out what exactly is a duplicate image. Analysing my photos, I found couple of interesting things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identical images: There were multiple copies of the same photo in different directories with different names.</li>
<li>Similar images: I usually bracket (exposure compensate or flash compensate) important pictures. So I have photos that visually appear to be the same, but may be a little darker/lighter based on exposure or flash settings.</li>
</ol>


<p>Identical photos (1) are easy to find. These files are exactly the same so their bit patterns are the same. We could simply compute the checksum (or md5) of the photos and compare to find identical images.</p>

<p>Finding similar photos (2) is a little more challenging. The photos are visually the same, but they have enough differences that their checksum do not compare. Some of the differences that I found:</p>

<ol>
<li>Exposure or flash compensated, so photos were slightly lighter/darker than the original.</li>
<li>A small difference in the point of focus or a slight change in point of view.</li>
<li>Photos with changed aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Resized photos, etc.</li>
</ol>


<p>I had to find a way to detect all these changes to a photo and mark all these as duplicates of the original.</p>

<p>Researching &#8220;image similarity detection algorithms&#8221; on the web yields several techniques and tools. The primary theme of all these techniques was to calculate a fingerprint or hash of the image based on the perseptual content, not the raw bits in the image. A perceptual fingerprint/hash is derived from the visual features of the image. Unlike cryptographic hash functions like MD5 which rely on the fact that small changes in input leads to drastically different hash values, perceptual hashes produce hash values close to one another if the visual features of images are similar.</p>

<h2>Image similarity algorithms</h2>

<p>There are several algorithms that can calculate an image fingerprint, some were based on heuristics while others had a solid mathematical backing. Here is a rundown of some of the techniques and tools I came across while researching this topic.</p>

<h3>Color histogram as fingerprint</h3>

<p>The simplest of these fingerprinting techniques is using color histograms. Essentially a color histogram will capture the color distribution of the image. By comparing the normalized color histogram of images we can see if the color distributions match.</p>

<p>This techniques is apparently used in image retrieval/matching systems and are a standard way of matching images that is very reliable, relatively fast and very easy to implement. This type of matching is pretty resiliant to scaling (once the histogram is normalised), and rotation/shifting/movement etc.</p>

<p>Here is an implementation of an histogram indexing as described in <a href="http://staff.science.uva.nl/~rein/UvAwiki/uploads/CV0708/swainballard.pdf">Indexing via colour histograms - Swain, Ballard - 1990</a>. See the table below to compare color histogram based similarity with other techniques.</p>

<h3>GQview&#8217;s image comparison</h3>

<p>GQview is an image viewer on Linux. It was one of the earliest programs that supported image similarity detection. Reading the <a href="http://fossies.org/linux/misc/gqview-2.1.5.tar.gz:a/gqview-2.1.5/src/similar.c" title="image_sim_compare function">code</a>, this is what it does to detect similar images:</p>

<ol>
<li>Divide the image into a 32 x 32 grid (1024 rectangles)</li>
<li>For each of the rectangle in the grid, average the red, green &amp; blue color channels and store in 3 seperate 32 x 32 array. These 32 x 32 arrays represents the signature of the image.</li>
<li>To compare two images, compute the signatures of both the images and calculate the average of the corresponding array differences. i.e. similarity = 1 - (abs(red[img1] - red[img2]) + abs(blue[img1] - blue[img2]) + abs(green[img1] - green[img2])) / 255 * 1024 * 3</li>
</ol>


<p> 1.0 is considered an exact match, while 0.0 for exact opposite images. Generally only a match of > 0.85 are significant at all, and >.95 is useful to find images that have been re-saved to other formats, dimensions, or compression.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.ostertag.name/HowTo/findimagedupes.shtml" title="findimagedupes.pl">findimagedupes.pl&#8217;s</a> algorithm</h2>

<p>A pearl script written by rob kudla in 2001. It basically creates a fingerprint of the photos using Image Magick after applying a series of reductions. From the <a href="http://www.ostertag.name/HowTo/findimagedupes.pl">code</a>, this is what findimagedupes does:</p>

<ol>
<li>standardize image size by resampling to 160x160.</li>
<li>grayscale it.</li>
<li>blur it a lot. (gets rid of noise)</li>
<li>normalize (spreads the intensity out as much as possible)</li>
<li>equalize (make it as contrasty as possible): this is for those real dark pictures that someone has slapped a pure white logo on.</li>
<li>resample down to 16x16.</li>
<li>reduce to 1bpp: This basically uses a threshold to convert each pixel to either a white (0) or black (1) to 1 bit value.</li>
<li>convert to raw mono</li>
<li>Get the first 32 bytes of the raw image data. This is basically the fingerprint of the image.</li>
</ol>


<p>When comparing images, findimagedups uses each images fingerprint and XORs them. The count of 1 bits in the result gives an approximate similarity score.</p>

<h2>Using average hashing</h2>

<p>This method is described by <a href="http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html" title="Average hashing">Dr. Neal Krawetz on the HackerFactor blog</a>. The basic idea was to filter out high frequencies in an image and just keep the low frequencies. With pictures, high frequencies give you detail, while low frequencies shows the structure. A large, detailed picture has lots of high frequencies. A very small picture lacks details, so it is all low frequencies.</p>

<p>Here is the algorithm Dr. Neal described:</p>

<ol>
<li>resize to a common 8x8 size. The fastest way to remove high frequencies and detail is to shrink the image.</li>
<li>grayscale it. This changes the hash from 64 pixels (64 red, 64 green, and 64 blue) to 64 total colors.</li>
<li>Compute the mean value of the 64 colors. This is the averaging of the hash.</li>
<li>Convert the 64 colors to 64 bits. Each bit is simply set based on whether the color value is above or below the mean.</li>
<li>Construct the hash. Set the 64 bits into a 64-bit integer. The order does not matter, just as long as you are consistent.</li>
<li>To compare two images, calculate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance" title="Hamming distance wikipedia article">Hamming distance</a> between two average hashes. A distance of zero indicates that it is likely a very similar picture (or a variation of the same picture). A distance of 5 means a few things may be different, but they are probably still close enough to be similar. But a distance of 10 or more? That&#8217;s probably a very different picture.</li>
</ol>


<p>According to Dr. Neal, the resulting hash won&#8217;t change if the image is scaled or the aspect ratio changes. Increasing or decreasing the brightness or contrast, or even altering the colors won&#8217;t dramatically change the hash value.</p>

<p>Here is an implementation of average hash using <a href="http://cimg.sourceforge.net/" title="CImg toolkit">CImg</a> library in C++. The similarity is computed as 1 - distance/64, so 1.0 means the images are similar. See the results of Average hash in the table below.</p>

<h2>Using Phash</h2>

<p>According to Dr. Neal, a better approach is using <a href="http://phash.org/" title="pHash">pHash</a>. Here is how pHash is computed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reduced to grayscale.</li>
<li>Resize the image to 32x32.</li>
<li>Compute the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform" title="Discrete Cosing Transform (DCT)">Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)</a> of the image. The DCT separates the image into a collection of frequencies and scalars.</li>
<li>Just keep the top-left 8x8 of the DCT. While the DCT is 32x32, the top-left 8x8 represents the lowest frequencies in the picture.</li>
<li>Compute the median value.</li>
<li>Compute the hash from the DCT. Set the 64 hash bits to 0 or 1 depending on whether each of the 64 DCT values is above or below the median value.</li>
</ol>


<p>pHash is the most promising of all (see table below). There is an opensource version of pHash library that can be easily used in Ruby.</p>

<h2>multi-resolution Haar wavelet decomposition</h2>

<p>ImgSeek is an opensource tool that computes image features based on an algorithm described in the paper <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/query/">Fast Multiresolution Image Querying</a>. These features consist of 41 numbers for each colour channel (the code currently works in the YIQ colourspace).</p>

<p>40 of these numbers will correspond to the 40 most significant wavelets found in a Haar wavelet decomposition of the image. The final number is based on the average luminosity of the image, and is basically a compensation factor. The image similarity is given by the sum of the weights for the most significant wavelet features, minus a component based on the average luminosity.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The table below shows the similarity scores for the following 4 images compared to the original.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>For the identical image (Original Vs Duplicate), Color histogram, Average Hash, pHash and imgseek returned 1.0, so they all can detect identical images.</li>
<li>For nearly identical images (Original Vs Exposure compensated) both imgseek and pHash gave a much better similarity score (~0.88) than Average hash (0.814). Color histogram did come very close at 0.81.</li>
<li>For scaled images (Original Vs Resized (90% of original)) imgseek was far better (0.99) than pHash (0.875) and Average Hash (0.625). I am not sure why Color histogram did rather poorly (0.00099). It could be something in my code.</li>
<li>For completely different images (Original vs Cropped), imgseek gave the biggest dis-similarity score (0.298) than both Average &amp; pHash.</li>
<li>imgseek was the fastest of all the fingerprinting techniques.</li>
</ol>


<p>Based on this, my choice was ImgSeek or pHash. I would have preferred to use imgseek, but I decided to use pHash as there was an open source implementation of <a href="http://phash.org" title="pHash">pHash</a> that can be easily used in a ruby script.</p>

<h2>Comparing pHashes of 200K images</h2>

<p>We know we can easily compute the hamming distance of two pHashes and see how similar they are. But when we have 200K images, we need to compare an image with a very large set of pHashes to compute similarity. Linear comparison is out of question. A hash can only give us exact matches or identical images but not similar images. We need a data structure that can find near matches to hashes within a threshold.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6389841/efficiently-find-binary-strings-with-low-hamming-distance-in-large-set">stack overflow entry</a> pointed me in the right direction.</p>

<p>Question: What do we know about the Hamming distance d(x,y)?</p>

<p>Answer:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is non-negative: d(x,y)  0</li>
<li>It is only zero for identical inputs: d(x,y) = 0  x = y</li>
<li>It is symmetric: d(x,y) = d(y,x)</li>
<li>It obeys the triangle inequality, d(x,z)  d(x,y) + d(y,z)</li>
</ol>


<p>This means that the Hamming distance is a metric for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space" title="Metric Space Wikipedia article">metric space</a>. There are good algorithms and data structures for indexing metric spaces: Metric tree, BK-tree, M-tree, VP-tree, Cover tree, etc.</p>

<p>In fact the open source pHash library has an implementation of Multi Vantage Point (MVP) trees. I needed more control over the tree nodes, so I decided to use a Burkhard Keller tree (BK-tree) in Ruby.</p>

<p>For a really good introduction to BK Trees see <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2007/4/Damn-Cool-Algorithms-Part-1-BK-Trees" title="BK Trees">Damn Cool Algorithms</a>.</p>

<h2>Photo Organizer Tool</h2>

<p>Finally, I wrote a general purpose photo organizer tool that reads the exif data in an image and copies it to a folder structure based on the data-time when the photo was taken. It uses pHash for generating image signatures and skips identical images and marks similar images as &#8220;DUPLICATE_OF&#8221; the original image.</p>

    <id>http://HackerLabs.github.com/blog/2012/05/09/from-bits-to-waves-the-inner-workings-of-an-ethernet-controller</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 10 years ago, I started hacking the Linux kernel. My interest was the TCP/IP stack and specifically the workings
of an Ethernet controller and its Linux driver. I picked one of the most widely used Ethernet controllers at that time,
the <a href="http://www.intel.com/design/network/products/lan/controllers/82559.htm" title="Intel 82559 10/100 Fast Ethernet Controller">Intel 82559 10/100 Fast Ethernet Controller</a> and one of its open-source drivers, the eepro100. My original aim was to
write a book, but after 10 years, I think its time I shared what I learnt.</p>

<p>In this article I want to talk about how the eepro100 driver interfaces with the Intel 82559 chipset and how the 82559
converts the packets sent by the driver to signals transmitted over physical wires. So, without further ado:</p>

<h2>The mighty 82559</h2>

<p>The 82559 is an Intel ethernet chipset. It supports 10/100 Mbps full duplex data communication over a pair of wires.
This is a high level block diagram of the 82559.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/82559-Block-Diagram.png" title="Block Diagram of 82559" ><span class='caption-text'>Block Diagram of 82559</span></span></p>

<p>The most important subsystems of 82559 are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A parallel subsystem (shown in green).</li>
<li>A FIFO subsystem (shown in red).</li>
<li>The 10/100 Mbps Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detect (CSMA/CD) unit (shown in blue).</li>
<li>The 10/100 Mbps physical layer (PHY) unit (shown in black).</li>
</ul>


<h3>The parallel subsystem</h3>

<p>The parallel subsystem is responsible for interfacing the chipset with the motherboard via the PCI bus. It also controls
and executes all the chipset&#8217;s functions via a Micro-Machine.</p>

<p>As a PCI device, 82559 can operate in two modes:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a PCI target (slave mode). In slave mode, 82559 is completely controlled by the host CPU. The CPU initiates all
transmit and receive actions when 82559 is in slave mode.</li>
<li>For processing the transmit and receive frames, the 82559 operates as a master on the PCI bus. It needs no help from
the host CPU to read/write memory or other resources and can work independently.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>micromachine </strong> is an embedded processing unit. Instructions for carrying out all the 82559&#8217;s functions are
embedded in a microcode ROM within the micromachine. The micromachine is divided into two units:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Receive Unit (RU)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Command Unit (CU)</strong>. The CU is also the transmit unit.</li>
</ul>


<p>These two units operate independently and concurrently. Control is switched between the two units according to the
microcode instruction flow. The independence of the Receive and Command units in the micromachine allows the 82559 to
execute commands and receive incoming frames simultaneously, with no real-time CPU intervention.</p>

<p>The 82559 also interfaces with an external Flash memory and an external serial EEPROM. The <strong>Flash memory</strong> may be used
for remote boot functions, network statistics, diagnostics and management functions. The <strong>EEPROM</strong> is used to store
relevant information for a LAN connection such as node address (MAC Address), as well as board manufacturing and
configuration information.</p>

<h3>FIFO Subsystem</h3>

<p>The 82559 FIFO (First In, First Out) subsystem consists of a 3 Kbyte transmit FIFO and 3 Kbyte receive FIFO. Each FIFO
is unidirectional and independent of the other. The FIFO subsystem serves as the interface between the 82559 parallel
side and the serial CSMA/CD unit. It provides a temporary buffer storage area for frames as they are either being
received or transmitted by the 82559. Transmit frames can be queued within the transmit FIFO, allowing back-to-back
transmission within the <a title="Interframe gap" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interframe_gap">minimum Interframe
Spacing (IFS)</a>. Transmissions resulting in errors (collision detection or data underruns) are re-transmitted directly
from the 82559 FIFO eliminating the need to re-access this data from the host system.</p>

<h3>CSMA/CD unit</h3>

<p>The CSMA/CD unit of the 82559 allows it to be connected to either a 10 or 100 Mbps Ethernet network. The CSMA/CD unit
performs all of the functions of the 802.3 protocol such as <a title="CSMA/CD"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSMA/CD">frame formatting, frame stripping, collision handling, deferral to link
traffic</a>, etc. The CSMA/CD unit can also be placed in a full duplex mode which allows simultaneous transmission and
reception of frames.</p>

<h3>Physical Unit (PHY)</h3>

<p>The <a title="PHY Layer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHY_%28chip%29">Physical Layer (PHY)</a> unit of the 82559
is where the digital data is converted to a signal that can propagate over the network wires. To make the actual
connection to the network, additional components such as transformers anmpedances re needed. This additional components
are external to 82559.</p>

<h3>Accessing 82559 as a PCI device</h3>

<p>A PCI peripheral boards can be accessed using three different address spaces: memory locations, I/O ports, and
configuration registers.</p>

<ul>
<li>The memory and I/O port address space is shared by all devices on a PCI bus (i.e., when you access a memory location,
all the devices see the bus cycle at the same time). A driver can read memory and I/O regions via inb, readb, and so
forth.</li>
<li>The configuration space, on the other hand, exploits geographical addressing. i.e. each PCI slot is uniquely addressed
(by a 16 bit address), thus eliminating collisions when configuring devices. To access the configuration space of
82559, the full configuration address (bus, slot, function, offset) is written to an I/O port (for 82559, CONFIG_ADDRESS
= 0xCF8) and then the 32-bit word at this address can be read or written through another location (for 82559,
CONFIG_DATA = 0xCFC ).</li>
</ul>


<p>After a PCI device is powered on, the hardware remains in an inactive state and the will only respond to configuration
transactions. This is because, at power on, the device does not have its memory and I/O ports mapped into the computer&#8217;s
address space. Every other device-specific feature, such as interrupt reporting, is disabled as well.</p>

<p>After power on, the BIOS must first scan the PCI bus to determine what PCI device exists and what configuration
requirements they have. In order to facilitate this process, all PCI devices, including 82559, must implement a base set
of configuration registers as defined by the PCe standard registers defined by 82559 is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/82559ConfigSpace.jpg" width="82559" title="Config Space" ><span class='caption-text'>Config Space</span></span></p>

<p>The BIOS reads the Vendor ID, Device ID and Class registers in order to detect the device and its type. 82559 being an
Intel device, returns a hard-coded 8086H for Device ID.</p>

<h3>Memory &amp; IO Mapping the 82559 device.</h3>

<p>Having detected 82559, the BIOS then accesses 82559&#8217;s base address configuration registers to determine how many blocks
of memory and/or IO space the device requires. Ese Address Register (BAR) is 32 bits wide and there can be upto 6 BARs
per device. 82559 defines 3 types of BARs, the Control/Status Registers (CSR), Flash, and Expansion ROM as shown in
figure above.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/BAR.jpg" title="Base Address Register (BAR)" ><span class='caption-text'>Base Address Register (BAR)</span></span></p>

<p>Bit zero in all base registers is read only and is used to determine whether the register maps into memory (0) or I/O
space (1).ach bove shows the layout of a BAR for memory mapping.</p>

<p>The 82559 contains three BARs, two requesting memory mapped resources and one requesting IO mapping.
specification.ontrol and Status Register (CSR) is both Memory Mapped (CSR Memory mapped base address register: 10H) and
IO mapped (CSR I/O Mapped Base Address Register: 14H) to anywhere within the 32- bit memory address space. It is up to
the driver (eepro100) to determine which BAR (I/O or Memory) to use to access the 82559 Control/Status registers. The
size of the memory space is 4Kb and that of I/O space is 32 bytes. The 82559 also requires one BAR (Flash Memory Mapped
Base Address Register: 18H) to map accesses to an optional FLASH memory.</p>

<p>After determining the types of mapping and amount of memory/IO space requested from the BARs, BIOS maps the I/O and
memory controllers into available memory locations and proceeds with system boot.</p>

<h3>The Kernel PCI Initialization</h3>

<p>As described above, for Intel based systems the system BIOS which ran at boot time has already fully configured the PCI
system. This leaves Linux kernel with little to do other than remap that configuration.</p>

<p>The PCI device driver (pci.c) starts by scanning PCI Buses and creates a pci_dev for every device (including PCI-to-PCI
bridges) and pci_bus for every bus it finds. These structures are linked together into a tree that mimics the actual PCI
topology.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/PCITree.jpg" title="PCI Tree" ><span class='caption-text'>PCI Tree</span></span></p>

<p>At this stage, the BIOS has recognized the 82559 and configured its PCI configuration space assigning it unique memory
and IO space and the Linux kernel has created a pci_dev data structure defining 82559.</p>

<h3>82559 PCI Initialization</h3>

<p>When the eepro100 driver module is loaded into the kernel, the driver registers itself as a PCI driver by calling
<em>pci_register_driver()</em>. Implicitly passed to <em>pci_register_driver()</em> is a table of all supported devices
(<em>eepro100_pci_tbl</em>).
over serves a range of Intel chipsets: 82557, 82558, 82559, 82801, etc.</p>

<p>After registering the driver, <em>pci_register_driver()</em> probes [<em>pci_device_probe()</em>] the PCI device tree
for all unclaimed PCI devices. Chances are that one of those devices could be an eepro100 compatible device. When an
unclaimed device is found, <em>pci_bus_match()</em> and <em>pci_match_device()</em> are called to check if this
unclaimed device is an eepro100 compliant PCI device.</p>

<p><em>pci_match_device()</em> checks if the PCI_VENDOR_ID, PCI_DEVICE_ID, PCI_SUBVENDOR_ID, PCI_SUBDEVICE_ID from the
<em>eepro100_pci_tbl</em> and the device configure header values match (see 82559 configuration space figure above). If
a match is found, eepro100&#8217;s probe function, <em>eepro100_init_one()</em>, is called to reset/probe the new device.
After the probe is complete, the device is marked as claimed by eepro100.</p>

<p><em>pci_find_capability()</em>: Every device that supports PCI power management, including 82559, has an 8 byte
capability field in its PCI configuration space (See address DCh - Eoh in the figure above). This field is used to
describe and control the standard PCI power management features. The PCI PM spec defines 4 operating states for devices,
D0 - D3. The higher the number, less power the device consumes but longer is the latency for the device to return to the
operational state (D0). 82559 supports all 4 power states. <em>pci_enable_device()</em> (via
<em>pci_set_power_state()</em>) activates 82559 by switching it to the D0 state.</p>

<p><em>pci_set_master()</em>: If the device has bus mastering capability, during bootup the BIOS can read two of its
configuration registers (Minimum Grant register: Min_Gnt and Maximum Latency register: Max_Lat, see configuration
registers in the above figure) to determine how quickly it requires access to the PCI bus when it asserts REQ# pin and
the average duration of its transfer when it has acquired ownership of the bus. The BIOS can utilize this information to
program the bus master&#8217;s latency timer register and the PCI bus arbiter to provide the optimum PCI bus utilization. For
82559, the default value of Minimum Grant Register is 08H and Maximum Latency Register is 18H. pci_set_master() is
called to enable 82559 to act as a bus master.</p>

<p>During boot, the BIOS had allocated a range of unique memory and IO regions for accessing 82559&#8217;s configuration space.
For the driver to use these regions, they have to be reserved and locked in the kernel by marking those regions as BUSY
(to prevent other drivers from accessing these same regions). <em>eepro100_init_one()</em> locks the PCI BIOS assigned
IO port regions using <em>request_region()</em> (cat /proc/ioports to see a list of all locked IO ports). Similarly to
reserve memory mapped regions <em>request_mem_region()</em> is called. This is done for all the 3 three regions pointed
to by the 3 active 82559 BARs.</p>

<p>The 82559 is now physically enabled and is ready to start receiving and transmitting ethernet frames. The driver now
prepares the kernel to start using this device for network access via <em>speedo_found1()</em>.</p>

<p><em>speedo_found1()</em>: The kernel needs to know that this is an Ethernet device and it can use this new PCI device to
send/receive data over the network. For this, a device specific structure, <em>net_device</em>, is create and registered
<em>register_netdevice()</em>with the kernel. <em>net_device</em> contains the device name, it&#8217;s MAC address, options
like full-duplex, interrupt number (IRQ) &amp; pointers to functions for executing all the device functions.</p>

<p>Every ethernet device found should have a unique name and on linux ethernet devices are named eth0, eth1&#8230;eth100.
<em>dev_alloc_name()</em> allocates a name for this device and sets it in <em>net_device</em> structure.</p>

<p>Every 802.3 device has an unique 48-bit MAC address assigned to it. This address is not hardcoded in 82559, but is
stored by the board manufacturer in a non-volatile form, such as in the EEPROM or Flash EPROM outside 82559.</p>

<p>82559 expects the EEPROM format to be as shown below.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/82559EEPROMFormat.jpg" width="82559" title="EEPROM Format" ><span class='caption-text'>EEPROM Format</span></span></p>

<p>The 82559 automatically reads five words (0H, 1H, 2H, AH, and DH) from the EEPROM during bootup. The MAC address is
extracted from 0H, 1H &amp; 2H. The rest of the EEPROM map contains device options like type of connector, the device
type, PHY device ID etc.</p>

<p><em>speedo_found1()</em> then proceeds to reset the 82559 chip using the PORT command (writing a zero value to the
SCBport, offset 8 in the CSR). The PORT commands is also used to self-test the 82559.</p>

<p>The kernel also needs to know what functions to call to open the device(<em>speedo_open</em>), transmit
(<em>speedo_start_xmit</em>), close/stop (<em>speedo_stop</em>), get stats (<em>speedo_get_stats</em>), do IOCTL
(<em>speedo_ioctl</em>). Notice that there is no receive function. This is because packets are received asynchronously.
When a new packet is received 82559 interrupts the kernel and the interrupt service routine handles the received packet
(more on this later). At this point the timer routines are also initialized.</p>

<p>This completes the initialization of 82559. The device is now ready to receive &amp; transmitt ethernet frames.</p>

<h3>Assigning an IP address to the device</h3>

<p>After initializing the device, the device should be opened so that it is accessible from the IP layer. The device is
accessible from the outside world when an IP address is assigned to it. One way to assign an IP address to an interface
is throught the ifconfig program available from the net-utils.</p>

<p>The syntax to enable the device is:</p>

<p><em>ifconfig eth0 up</em></p>

<p>When asked to bring up the eth0 interface, ifconfig creates a generic raw TCP socket to the afinet address family and
issues a SIOCSIFFLAG ioctl to this raw socket. The flags set on the interface are the IFF_UP &amp; IFF_RUNNING.</p>

<p><em>devinet_ioctl()</em> fetches the user space defined <em>ifreq</em> structure containing the name of our interface
and the IP address to the kernel space. Based on the name of the interface (eth0, for e.g.), the device structure,
<em>net_device</em> (remember we created this in speedo_foun1() above?), is looked up [ <em>__dev_get_by_name()</em>].
The IP is set to this device by <em>inet_set_ifa()</em>.</p>

<h3>Shared Memory Communication Architecture</h3>

<p>After initialization, 82559 is ready for its normal operation. As a Fast Ethernet Controller, its normal operation is to
transmit and receive data packets. As a PCI bus master device, 82559 works independently, without CPU intervention. The
CPU provides the 82559 with action commands and pointers to the data buffers that reside in host main memory. The 82559
independently manages these structures and initiates burst memory cycles to transfer data to and from main memory.</p>

<p>The CPU controls and examines 82559 via its control and status structures. Some of these control and status structures
reside within the 82559 and some reside in system memory. For transfer of data to/from the CPU, the 82559 establishes a
shared memory communication with the host CPU. This shared memory is divided into three parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Control/Status Registers (CSR)</li>
<li>The Command Block List (CBL) or just Command List (CL)</li>
<li>The Receive Frame Area (RFA).</li>
</ul>


<p>The CSR resides on-chip and can be accessed by either I/O or memory cycles (after the PCI BIOS has mapped this region to
a region accessible by the CPU. See the section PCI Kernel Initialization), while the CBL and RFA reside in system
(host) memory.</p>

<p>Command Block List (CBL) is a linked list of commands to be executed by 82559. Receive Frame Area (RFA) is a linked list
of data structures that holds the received packets (frames).</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/82559SharedMemoryArchitecture_good.jpg" width="82559" title="Shared Memory Architecture" ><span class='caption-text'>Shared Memory Architecture</span></span></p>

<h4>Controlling 82559 through CSR</h4>


<p>The 82559 has seven Control/Status registers which make up the CSR space.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class="/images/from-bits-to-waves/82559CSR.jpg 82559" src="Command/Status" title="Registers (CSR)" ><span class='caption-text'>Registers (CSR)</span></span></p>

<p>The first 8 bytes of the CSR is called the System Control Block (SCB). The SCB serves as a central communication point
for exchanging control and status information between the host CPU and the 82559.</p>

<p>The CPU instructs the 82559 to Activate, Suspend, Resume or Idle the Command Unit (CU) or Receive Unit (RU) by placing
the appropriate control command in the CU or RU control field of SCB. Activating the CU causes the 82559 to begin
transmitting packets. When transmission is completed, the 82559 updates the SCB with the CU status then interrupts the
CPU, if configured to do so. Activating the RU causes the 82559 to go into the READY state for frame reception. When a
frame is received the RU updates the SCB with the RU status and interrupts the CPU.</p>

<h3>Command Block List (CBL) and Transmitted Frame</h3>

<p>Transmit or configure commands issued by CPU are wrapped inside what are called Command Blocks (CB). These command
blocks are chained together to form the CBL.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/82559ActionCommand.jpg" title="Action Command" ><span class='caption-text'>Action Command</span></span></p>

<p>Action commands are categorized into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-Tx commands: This category includes commands such as NOP, Configure, IA Setup, Multicast Setup, Dump and Diagnose.</li>
<li>Tx command: This command causes the 82559 to transmit a frame. A transmit command block contains (in the parameter
field) the destination address, length of the transmitted frame and a pointer to buffer area in memory containing the
data portion of the frame. The data field is contained in a memory data structure consisting of a buffer descriptor (BD)
and a data buffer, or a linked list of buffer descriptors and buffers (as shown in figure below).</li>
</ul>


<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/82559DataBuffer.jpg" title="Data buffer" ><span class='caption-text'>Data buffer</span></span></p>

<p>When eepro100 is ready to transmit a packet, it must create this Tx command block and send it to 82559. This Tx Command
block is a structure called TxFD (Transmit Frame Descriptor).</p>

<p>This TxFD can hold one TxCB and two Tx Buffer Descriptors (TxBD). During eepro100 initialization
(<em>speedo_found1()&lt;/em), a fixed number of these TxFD&#8217;s are created and linked together into a ring

<h3>Receive Frame Area</h3>

<p>To reduce CPU overhead, the 82559 is designed to receive frames without CPU supervision. The host CPU first sets aside
an adequate receive buffer space and then enables the 82559 Receive Unit (This is done in <em>speedo_init_rx_ring</em>
when the device is opened: <em>speedo_open</em>). Once enabled, the RU watches for arriving frames and automatically
stores them in the Receive Frame Area (RFA).</p>

<p>The RFA contains Receive Frame Descriptors, Receive Buffer Descriptors, and Receive Buffers (see figure below).</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/82559FlexibleReceiveStructure1.jpg" title="Flexible Receive Structure" ><span class='caption-text'>Flexible Receive Structure</span></span></p>

<p>The individual Receive Frame Descriptors make up a Receive Descriptor List (RDL) used by the 82559 to store the
destination and source addresses, the length field, and the status of each frame received.</p>

<h2>Data Transmission</h2>

<p>An application calls <em>write(socket, data, length)</em> system call to write to an open socket. In the kernel,
<em>inet_sendmsg()</em> is executed with a pointer to the sock structure. <em>inet_sendmsg()</em> calls the send
operation of the corresponding transport protocol which for TCP is <em>tcp_sendmsg()</em>. <em>tcp_sendmsg()</em> copies
the data to be transmitted from the user space to the socket and starts the transmit process by calling
<em>tcp_send_skb()</em> and subsequently <em>tcp_transmitt_skb()</em>. <em>tcp_transmitt_skb()</em> adds the TCP Header
to the packet, calculate the TCP checksum and call the <em>ip_queue_xmit()</em>. Determining the ip route and
construction of the IP header happens in <em>ip_queue_xmit()</em>. Finally the MAC address is copied to the packet and
<em>dev_queue_xmit()</em> is called to send the packet to the ethernet device.</p>

<p><em>dev_queue_xmit()</em> points to a driver specific function. In case of eepro100, this function is
<em>speedo_start_xmit()</em> (remember we set this in <em>speedo_found1()</em>?).</p>

<p><em>speedo_start_xmit()</em> inserts any data received from the kernel (skb) into the Tx ring. If there are no open
slots in the Tx ring, <em>netif_stop_queue()</em> is called to request the kernel to stop sending more packets from the
upper layers and flag the Tx ring as full. The new skb (data) to be transmitted is inserted as the data portion of a
TxFD at <em>tx_buf_addr0</em> (See TxFD above).</p>

<p>The TxFD status of this entry is set to <em>CmdSuspend</em> (suspend after completion), <em>CmdTx</em> and
<em>CmdFlex</em> (flexible transmission mode). The last command inserted into the Tx ring has the <em>CmdSuspend</em>
bit set so that the CU is suspended immediately after the last command is executed. This way we prevent any erroneous
data from being transmitted. We have to clear the <em>CmdSuspend</em> from the previous command already in the Tx ring
before doing this. If the Tx ring is more than half full, we also set <em>CmdIntr</em> (interrupt after completion). The
causes the chip to generates an interrupt after executing this command. When an interrupt is received after transmit
completes, the interrupt handler calls <em>speedo_tx_buffer_gc()</em> to clean up completed and erroneous skb from the
Tx ring.</p>

<p>Finally, we activate the CU to transmit this new packet by issuing <em>CmdResume</em> to SCB.</p>

<h3>Generating the Ethernet Frame</h3>

<p>The final ethernet frame sent over the wire is:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/EthernetFrameFormat.jpg" title="Ethernet Frame Format" ><span class='caption-text'>Ethernet Frame Format</span></span></p>

<p>82559 automatically generates the preamble (alternating 1s and 0s) and start frame delimiter, fetches the destination
address and length field from the Transmit command, inserts its unique MAC address (that it fetched from the external
Flash/EEPROM) as the source address, fetches the data field specified by the Transmit command, and computes and appends
the CRC to the end of the frame.</p>

<p>This final frame is then handed over to the PHY layer for transmission over the wire.</p>

<h3>Bits to Waves</h3>

<p>82559 has an internal 82555 Physical Layer Interface (PHY). It is responsible for connecting the 82559 to the actual
physical wire over which the data will be carried. PHY converts the incoming digital data to analog signals during
transmission and analog signals to digital data during reception.</p>

<h4>Signal Transmission</h4>


<p>To achieve a high transfer rate (upto 125Mbps), two tasks must be performed to the data before it is transmitted over
the wire:</p>

<ul>
<li>scrambling/descrambling</li>
<li>encoding/decoding</li>
</ul>


<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/100BaseTxPHYModule.jpg" title="PHY Module" ><span class='caption-text'>PHY Module</span></span></p>

<h4>Scrambling/Descrambling</h4>


<p>All data transmitted and received over wire are synchronized with a clock. To keep the receiver in sync with the
transmitter, the clock signals have to be embedded in the signal transmitted over the wire itself. The robustness of
this digitally transmitted synchronization signal often depends on the statistical nature of the data being transmitted.
For example, long strings of 0’s and 1’s can cause loss of the synchronization since the receiver clock is derived from
the received data. Therefore, data must contain adequate transitions to assure that the timing recovery circuit at the
receiver will stay in synchronization. Scrambling (randomizing) the data over a period of time spreads these patterns.</p>

<h4>Encoding/Decoding</h4>


<p>There are different ways to represent the digital 1 &amp; 0 over the wire. The most widely used is Non-Return to Zero
(NRZI) format. NRZI, is a two level unipolar code (0 and V) representing a &#8220;one&#8221; by a transition between two levels and
a &#8220;zero&#8221; is represented by no transition as shown in the figure below. Another format is MLT-3. MLT-3 is a three level
eenting a &#8220;one&#8221; by a transition between two levels and &#8220;zero&#8221; as no transition as shown in figure below. MLT-3 has the
advantage that the maximum fundamental frequency of MLT-3 is one-half that of NRZI. With the MLT-3 coding scheme, 90% of
the spectral energy is below 40MHz versus 70MHz for NRZI. Thus we can achieves the same data rate as NRZI, but do not
require a wideband transmission medium. The work of the encoder/decoder is to convert between NRZI and MLT-3.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/BitsOnWire.jpg" title="Bits on Wire" ><span class='caption-text'>Bits on Wire</span></span></p>

<p>Finally, the MLT-3 encoded data is transmitted over the wire. It is important to isolate the the PHY from the CAT-5
Ethernet cable for load balancing and also feedback. This is done by using specialized Ethernet magnetics with each side
of the transformer referenced to the appropriate ground.</p>

<h4>Signal Reception</h4>


<p>Once the PHY detects signals on the receive side, it decodes and descrambles it to reconstruct the data transmitted by
the receiver.</p>

<h4>Receiving Frames</h4>


<p>To reduce CPU overhead, the 82559 is designed to receive frames without CPU supervision. The eepro100 had already setup
the address of the receive buffer ring in the SCB as part of initialization. Once the 82559 receive unit (RU) is
enabled, the RU watches for arriving frames and automatically stores them in the Rx ring / Receive Frame Area (RFA). The
RFA contains Receive Frame Descriptors, Receive Buffer Descriptors, and Data Buffers (see Figure 2). The individual
Receive Frame Descriptors make up a Receive Descriptor List (RDL) used by the 82559 to store the destination and source
addresses, the length field, and the status of each frame received.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/images/from-bits-to-waves/82559FlexibleReceiveStructure.jpg" title="Flexible Receive Structure" ><span class='caption-text'>Flexible Receive Structure</span></span></p>

<p>82559 checks each passing frame for an address match. The 82559 will recognize its own unique address, one or more
multicast addresses, or the broadcast address. If a match is found, 82559 stores the destination address, source
addresses and the length field in the next available Receive Frame Descriptor (RFD). It then begins filling the next
available Data Buffer on the Receive Buffer Descriptor (RBD). As one Data Buffer is filled, the 82559 automatically
fetches the next Data Buffer &amp; RBD until the entire frame is received.</p>

<p>Once the entire frame is received without error, a frame received interrupt status bit is posted in the SCB and an
interrupt is sent to the CPU.</p>

<p>The interrupt handler (<em>speedo_interrupt()</em>) checks if the receive interrupt bit is set in SCB and calls
<em>speedo_rx()</em> to handle the received packet.</p>

<p>The receive is a very simple process as most of the work is handled by the 82559 chip. 82559 while storing the packet on
the Rx ring has already determined the size of the packet, it stores this along with other relevent information like the
receive status in the Rx buffer. <em>speedo_rx()</em> checks the status to make sure there were no errors in receiving
the frame.</p>

<p>The driver receives packets into full-sized buffers - 1560 bytes. When a packet comes in, the driver needs to make a
decision. Does it use the whole 1560 bytes for this packet, or does it allocate a smaller buffer on-the-fly and copy the
data into it? If the size of the frame received is smaller than the <em>rx_copybreak</em>, then a new buffer is
allocated and the data is copied into it. If the packet is larger than <em>rx_copybreak</em>, we remove the received
skbuff (leaving a hole in the Rx ring) and pass this buffer to the higher applications. We later call
<em>speedo_refill_rx_buffers()</em> to refill the hole in the Rx ring.</p>

<p>The type of protocol of this packet is determined by calling <em>eth_type_trans()</em>. The packet is then queued for
the upper layers to process using the <em>netif_rx()</em>. Finally we refill the buffer we just took out of the Rx ring.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lucene is high-performance, scalable, full-featured, open-source text search engine written in Java. Since I am a search engineer by profession, I wanted to learn more about Lucene and its internals.</p>

<p>This article is about the index format of the 3.4 Lucene. Specifically the Lucene inverted index.</p>

<h2>Lucene Inverted Index</h2>

<h3>Some Definitions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Index:</strong> An Index is basically a set of documents that are to be searched. The index may be composed of multiple sub-indexes, or segments. Each segment is a fully independent index, which could be searched separately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fields:</strong> When a document is added to an index, different sections of the document are identified and are given common names called fields. e.g. Document title, document body, hyperlinks, the document URL, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Terms:</strong> The words in the fields are extracted and are stored in the index as terms. A term is basically a string extracted from the document.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The same string in two different fields is considered a different term.</p></li>
<li><p>Terms are represented as a pair of strings, the first naming the field, and the second naming text within the field.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stored/Indexed</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In Lucene, fields may be <em>stored</em>, in which case their text is stored in the index literally, in a non-inverted manner.</p></li>
<li><p>Fields that are inverted are called <em>indexed</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>A field may be both stored and indexed.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tokenized/Non-Tokenized</strong> :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The text of a field may be <em>tokenized</em> into terms to be indexed, or the text of a field may be used literally as a term to be indexed.</p></li>
<li><p>Most fields are tokenized, but sometimes it is useful for certain identifier fields to be indexed literally.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>IndexInterval:</strong> In order to accelerate the searching of a term, lucene uses a multi level skip-list. The index interval is the interval at which the terms are saved in the .tii file. For e.g., assuming IndexInterval=4, the dictionary index (tii) file will save the 4th, 8th, 12th term, which can speed up dictionary lookup in tis.</p>

<p><strong>SkipInterval:</strong> SkipInterval is the fraction of TermDocs stored in skip tables. It is used to accelerate TermDocs.skipTo(int). Larger values result in smaller indexes, greater acceleration, but fewer accelerable cases, while smaller values result in bigger indexes, less acceleration (in case of a small value for MaxSkipLevels) and more accelerable cases.</p>

<p><strong>MaxSkipLevels: </strong>MaxSkipLevels is the max. number of skip levels stored for each term in the .frq file. A low value results in smaller indexes but less acceleration, a larger value results in slighly larger indexes but greater acceleration. See format of .frq file for more information about skip levels.</p>

<p><strong>PrefixLength: </strong>Term text prefixes are shared. The PrefixLength is the number of initial characters from the previous term which must be pre-pended to a term&#8217;s suffix in order to form the term&#8217;s text. Thus, if the previous term&#8217;s text was &#8220;bone&#8221; and the term is &#8220;boy&#8221;, the PrefixLength is two and the suffix is &#8220;y&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>DocumentFrequency: </strong>DocFreq is the count of documents which contain the term.</p>

<p><strong>FrequencyDelta: </strong>FreqDelta determines the position of this term&#8217;s TermFreqs within the .frq file. In particular, it is the difference between the position of this term&#8217;s data in that file and the position of the previous term&#8217;s data (or zero, for the first term in the file).</p>

<p><strong>ProxyDelta:</strong> ProxDelta determines the position of this term&#8217;s TermPositions within the .prx file. In particular, it is the difference between the position of this term&#8217;s data in that file and the position of the previous term&#8217;s data (or zero, for the first term in the file.</p>

<p><strong>SkipDelta:</strong> SkipDelta determines the position of this term&#8217;s SkipData within the .frq file. In particular, it is the number of bytes after TermFreqs that the SkipData starts. In other words, it is the length of the TermFreq data.</p>

<h3>Term Frequencies (.frq)</h3>

<p>This file contains (TermPostingList * TermCount) entries. Each entry is a posting list corresponding to a term. Each posting list consists of Term Frequency and a Skip list.</p>

<p><strong>Term Frequency</strong> consists of a list of DocDeltas, and the number of times this term occurs in that doc. The DocDelta encodes both the document number and the frequency. In particular, DocDelta/2 is the difference between this document number and the previous document number (or zero when this is the first document in a TermFreqs). When DocDelta is odd, the frequency is one. When DocDelta is even, the frequency is read as another VInt.</p>

<p><strong>If omitTf = FALSE</strong> (Store the term frequency)</p>

<p>For example, if a term occurs once in document seven [DocID = 7, Freq = 1] and three times in document eleven [DocID = 11, Freq = 3], we would get the following sequence of VInts: 15, 8, 3. Here is how this is calculated:</p>

<p>In order to save space, Lucene does not store the doc id as is, instead it calculates a delta:</p>

<p>[DocIDDelta = 7, Freq = 1] [DocIDDelta = 4 (11-7), Freq = 3]</p>

<p>For the first term, since the frequency is 1, the frequency information is encoded in the DocDelta itself. DocIDDelta = 7 and in binary is 000 0111. Since we want to store the frequency of 1 in DocDelta, (7 &lt;&lt; 1) | 1 = 15. The last bit in the docdelta is 1 (docid is odd), so we know that frequency is encoded in the docdelta and freq = 1.</p>

<p>For the second term, since frequency > 1, we use a separate vint to encode the frequency. DocIDDelta = 4 in binary 0000 0100. Since we want to show that the following int is for frequency and not another docid, we need to make the last bit 0 (zero). (4 &lt;&lt; 1) | 0 = 8, then followed by real Freq = 3.</p>

<p>So to get the sequence: [DocDelta = 15] [DocDelta = 8, Freq = 3], namely sequence, 15,8,3.</p>

<p><strong>If omitTf = TRUE </strong>(Skip storing term frequency)</p>

<p>If omitTf were true it would be this sequence of VInts instead: 7,4.  If we omit term frequency, then all we are storing is the docdeltas. The DocDeltas are therefore [DocId=7][DocId=11] = [DocDelta=7][DocDelta=11-7] = 7,4</p>

<p><strong>SkipData:</strong> The skip data contains a set of skip lists that allows us to find a TermFrequency (DocDelta, freq) quickly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Number of skip levels in the SkipData = NumSkipLevels = Min (MaxSkipLevels, floor (log (DocFreq / log (SkipInterval )))). DocFreq = DocCount that contains this term.</p></li>
<li><p>Number of nodes in each skip level = DocFreq / (SkipInterval ^ (Level + 1)), level >= 0</p></li>
<li><p>All the SkipLevels are appended together, preceded by a SkipLevelLength. The last level does not need a SkipLevelLength since there are no more levels below it, so it is skipped.</p></li>
<li><p>All SkipDatum in all levels, except the last level have a SkipChildLevelPtr which points to the next skip level.</p></li>
<li><p>Each SkipDatum (SkipNode) contains the following information: document number, payload length, FreqSkip, ProxSkip, SkipChildLevelPtr.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For Example:</p>

<p>If SkipInterval = 4, MaxSkipLevels = 2, DocFreq = 35, then:</p>

<p>Skip level 0 has 8 SkipData entries ( = 35 / (4 ^ (0 + 1))), containing the 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, 19th, 23rd, 27th, and 31st document numbers in TermFreqs.</p>

<p>Skip level 1 has 2 SkipData entries ( = 35 / (4 ^ (1 + 1))), containing the 15th and 31st document numbers in TermFreqs.</p>

<p>Thus for SkipInterval 4, and when there are 35 documents, Skip level = 0 should include documents 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, and 31, and Skip level = 1 should include 15, 31 documents. But in the real implementation we store the previous docs as shown below.</p>

<p>PositionDelta is the difference between the position of the current occurrence in the document and the previous occurrence (or zero, if this is the first occurrence in this document). For example, the TermPositions for a term which occurs as the fourth term in one document, and as the fifth and ninth term in a subsequent document, would be the following sequence of VInts:  4, 5, 4</p>

<p>Payload in Apache Lucene is an arbitrary byte array stored at a specific position (i.e. a specific token/term) in the index.  A payload can be used to store weights for specific terms or things like part of speech tags or other semantic information.</p>

<p>PayloadLength is the length of the PayloadData. If there is no payload length, but a PayloadData is found, its length is the same as the previous Payload.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every fact you learn about a person reduces the &#8220;entropy&#8221; of their identity. For e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I know your gender, we can eliminate about 50% of the population: There were about 155.6 million females &amp; 151.4 million males in the United States in 2009.</p></li>
<li><p>If I know your birthday we can eliminate a much larger percentage of the population: At age 85 and older, there were more than twice as many women as men. People under 20 years of age made up over a quarter of the U.S. population (27.3%), and people age 65 and over made up one-eighth (12.8%) in 2009.</p></li>
<li><p>We can narrow you down even more if we know your zip code</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these facts independently narrow down the population, so much so that the combination of gender, ZIP code, birth date was <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.91.4147&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">unique for about 63% of the U.S</a>. population.</p>

<h3>Lets see how this works:</h3>

<p>Every time we learn a new fact about a person, there is less uncertainty about that person. Remember, entropy is a measure of this uncertainty. When we learn a new fact about a person, that fact reduces the entropy of their identity by a certain amount. There is a formula to say how much:</p>

<p>ΔS = -ln Pr(X=x)</p>

<p>Where ΔS is the reduction in entropy, measured in bits and Pr(X=x) is simply the probability that the fact would be true of a random person. Let&#8217;s apply the formula to a few facts, just for fun:</p>

<p>Starsign: ΔS = -ln Pr(STARSIGN=capricorn) = -ln (1/12) = 3.58 bits of information
Birthday: ΔS = -ln Pr(DOB=2nd of January) = -ln (1/365) = 8.51 bits of information</p>

<p>In the examples above, each starsign and birthday was assumed to be equally likely. The calculation can also be applied to facts which have non-uniform likelihoods. For instance, the likelihood that an unknown person&#8217;s ZIP code is 90210 (Beverley Hills, California) is different to the likelihood that their ZIP code would be 40203 (part of Louisville, Kentucky). As of 2007, there were 21,733 people living in the 90210 area, only 452 in 40203, and around 6.625 billion on the planet.</p>

<p>Knowing my ZIP code is 90210: ΔS = -ln (21,733/6,625,000,000) = 18.21 bits
Knowing my ZIP code is 40203: ΔS = -ln (452/6,625,000,000) = 23.81 bits
Knowing that I live in Moscow: ΔS = -ln (10524400/6,625,000,000) = 9.30 bits</p>

<p>How much entropy is needed to identify someone?</p>

<p>As of 2007, identifying someone from the entire population of the planet required:</p>

<p>S = ln (1/6625000000) = 32.6 bits of information.</p>

<p>Conservatively, we can round that up to 33 bits.</p>

<p>So for instance, if we know someone&#8217;s birthday, and we know their ZIP code is 40203, we have 8.51 + 23.81 = 32.32 bits; that&#8217;s almost, but perhaps not quite, enough to know who they are: there might be a couple of people who share those characteristics. Add in their gender, that&#8217;s 33.32 bits, and we can probably say exactly who the person is.</p>

<p>So, in the end if we are all just 33 bits, This is me: 000000010101101101000010101001111</p>

<p>P.S. Challenge: Decode this:  000000010101101101000010101001111</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Without using magic or trickery, God would need utmost <a href="http://cube20.org/">20</a> moves to solve any scrambled 3 x 3 x 3 Rubik&#8217;s cube. The best I can do is in 67 moves.</p></blockquote>

<p>I got my first Rubik&#8217;s cube when I was 11 years old. After years of trying to solve it, my greatest accomplishment was solving 2 adjacent faces. I would give up trying to solve the entire cube after fiddling with it for hours. I was still proud of what I could solve though; every one else I knew could not even solve 1 face.</p>

<p>God&#8217;s number is the smallest number of moves it takes to solve a general Rubik&#8217;s cube. In the case of the familiar 3x3x3 cube it was proved that 20 moves are always enough to solve even the hardest scramble. Finding this result took 35 years of computer time for researchers in Google. We still don&#8217;t know the size of God&#8217;s number for any cube other than the standard 3x3x3 but we do now know how it varies with the size of the cube. The remarkable thing is that it gets easier as the cube gets bigger.</p>

<p>There is now an answer to this question in a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5736">paper</a> to be presented at the 19th Annual European Symposium on Algorithms.</p>

<p>This paper shows that using a dumb approach to solving a nxnxn problem is to perform a set of moves that places a single sub-cube in its correct position and repeat until all the faces are complete. This gives an upper bound of order n<sup>2.</sup> However, it is well known that you can usually do better by using moves that place multiple sub-cubes into their correct location. These heuristics have now been made formal and this resulted in order n<sup>2/logn</sup> being the new upper bound. Now this has also been shown to be the lower bound in the same paper. What this means is that the smallest number of moves required to solve the nxnxn Rubik&#8217;s cube is proportional to n<sup>2/log(n).</sup> Notice that this result doesn&#8217;t tell us God&#8217;s Number for a cube of any size, only that it is proportional to n<sup>2/log(n).</sup></p>

<h2>A simple algorithm to solve Rubik&#8217;s cube</h2>

<p>Over the past couple of months, my interest in the cube was piqued again while I was reading an article on <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~jjchen/docs/Group%20Theory%20and%20the%20Rubik%27s%20Cube.pdf">Group theory and Rubik&#8217;s cube</a>. I finally decided to understand the cube and figure out how to solve it. I was not interested in finding the fastest or most optimal solution, but a simple solution that I could remember.</p>

<p><img src="http://HackerLabs.github.com/io/wp-content/themes/cleanr/images/Rubiks/Sides.jpg" alt="Names for six sides of cube, Up (U), Down (D), Right (R), Left (L), Front (F), Back (B) " /></p>

<p>This figure shows the labels we will be using when referring to the sides of the cube. We&#8217;ll use the one-letter abbreviations shown (U, D, F, B, L, R) in the algorithm below.</p>

<p>A move is a twist (quarter turn) of one of the faces of cube in the clockwise direction. The letter &#8220;i&#8221; means inverse, or counter-clockwise twists.</p>

<p>Hints:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Before you start each move, make sure your thumbs are on the F side of the cube to ensure consistent orientation for all the sequences.</p></li>
<li><p>To turn a face in the right direction, imagine that you are facing that side of the cube before making the turn.</p></li>
<li><p>If you mess up along the way, just restart from Step 1.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Lets start with a color to solve, say orange:</p>

<h4>STEP 1: Solve the Upper Orange Cross</h4>

<p>To solve the orange cross, you have to solve the orange edge pieces on their own. If you have an edge piece in the correct place but flipped the wrong way, hold the cube with the piece in the upper-right position as in the diagram, and do the sequence Ri U Fi Ui to flip that piece only.</p>

<p>Before</p>

<p><strong>Ri U Fi Ui</strong></p>

<p>After</p>

<h4>STEP 2: Solve the Orange Corners</h4>

<p>Find a corner piece in the bottom layer that belongs on top. Turn the bottom layer until the piece is directly below its home in the top layer. Hold the cube with the piece on the lower-front-right and its home at the upper-front-right and then do the sequence Ri Di R D 1, 3, or 5 times until that corner is solved.
If you find a corner piece that&#8217;s already in the top layer but the wrong spot or flipped the wrong way, hold the cube with the piece in the upper-front-right position and do Ri Di R D once. Now the piece is on the bottom and ready to be solved using the Ri Di R D sequence.</p>

<p>Before</p>

<p><strong>Ri Di R D
(x1, 3 or 5)</strong></p>

<p>After</p>

<h4>STEP 3: Solve the Middle Layer Edges</h4>

<p>Flip the cube so orange is on the bottom. Find the white-green edge piece. If it&#8217;s on top, turn it so it matches one of the diagrams below. Then do the corresponding sequence to solve it. If the white-green edge is somewhere in the middle layer but it&#8217;s in the wrong place or flipped the wrong way, hold the cube so the edge is in the front-right position and do either sequence once: U R Ui Ri Ui Fi U F or Ui Fi U F U R Ui Ri (This may require that you rotate the cube to a new face). After the move, the piece is in the top layer and you can solve it as described above. Repeat for the other 3 middle-layer edges.</p>

<p>Before</p>

<p><strong>U R Ui Ri Ui Fi U F</strong></p>

<p>After</p>

<p>Before</p>

<p><strong>Ui Fi U F U R Ui Ri</strong></p>

<h4>STEP 4: Solve the Upper Red Cross</h4>

<p>Turn the top layer until the edges match one of the diagrams. Repeat the following sequence as many times as it takes to get a red cross: F R U Ri Ui Fi.</p>

<p>Before</p>

<p><strong>F R U Ri Ui Fi</strong></p>

<p>After</p>

<p>Before</p>

<p>Before</p>

<h4>STEP 5: Solve to Top Edges</h4>

<p>Hold the cube with white in front. Turn the top layer until the red and white edge piece is solved as in the diagram, and then repeat the following sequence until the green and red edge piece is also solved on the right side: R U Ri U R U U Ri. Now turn the whole cube so that blue is the front face. If the top blue edge isn&#8217;t solved, do the sequence again followed by an extra U.</p>

<p>Before</p>

<p>Shorthand: <strong>R U Ri U R U U Ri</strong></p>

<p>After</p>

<h4>STEP 6: Solve the Top Corners</h4>

<p>In this step, you&#8217;ll get all of the corner pieces in the top layer into their correct positions. One or more of them may be twisted the wrong way, but we&#8217;ll take care of that in the last step. The only thing to worry about here is to make sure that each of the corner pieces is in the right place.</p>

<p>Find a corner piece that&#8217;s in the right place and hold the cube with that piece above your right thumb. Don&#8217;t turn the top layer at all, as it well mess up all the effort from Step 5. Do the following sequence once or twice to put the rest of the corners into place: U R Ui Li U Ri Ui L. If you can&#8217;t find a corner piece in the right place, just do the sequence once before you start.</p>

<p>Before</p>

<p><strong>U R Ui Li U Ri Ui L</strong></p>

<p>After</p>

<h4>STEP 7: Solve the Top Corners (Again)</h4>

<p>This is it, the final step in solving the puzzle! This step is just a little bit tricky, so it is important to follow the directions carefully, or you&#8217;ll lose all your hard work and have to start over.</p>

<p>Keeping the unsolved layer on top, rotate the cube until you find a corner piece that needs to be flipped (i.e., top color does not match top layer). Position that corner in the upper-front-right corner. From now on, you need to keep the cube in this orientation. Remember the color of the front center piece, and make sure to keep that piece in the front position from now on.</p>

<p>Do the sequence Ri Di R D 2 or 4 times to orient the selected corner piece. The cube will get scrambled in the process, but don&#8217;t worry.</p>

<p>Next, rotate the top layer clockwise, until you find another corner that needs to be flipped. Repeat the sequence until all the corners are oriented properly.</p>

<p>Before</p>

<p><strong>Ri Di R D</strong>
(x2 or 4)</p>

<p>After</p>

<p>Congratulations, your cube is solved.</p>
